HALF-LIFE sends a shock through the game industry with its combination of pounding action and continuous, immersive storytelling. Valve's debut title wins more than 50 game-of-the-year awards on its way to being named \"Best PC Game Ever\" by PC Gamer, and launches a franchise with more than eight million retail units sold worldwide.<br><br>\r\n\t\tNOW. By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original, and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life 2 opens the door to a world where the player's presence affects everything around him, from the physical environment to the behaviors even the emotions of both friends and enemies.<br><br>\r\n\t\tThe player again picks up the crowbar of research scientist Gordon Freeman, who finds himself on an alien-infested Earth being picked to the bone, its resources depleted, its populace dwindling. Freeman is thrust into the unenviable role of rescuing the world from the wrong he unleashed back at Black Mesa. And a lot of people he cares about are counting on him.<br><br>\r\n\t\tThe intense, real-time gameplay of Half-Life 2 is made possible only by Source&reg;, Valve's new proprietary engine technology.

The Orcs, a race the hero had always hated, have put together a rescue squad that frees the hero from his bonds. He emerges into a land desecrated by evil.

Click here!</a></strong><br><br>PAYDAY 2 is an action-packed, four-player co-op shooter that once again lets gamers don the masks of the original PAYDAY crew - Dallas, Hoxton, Wolf and Chains - as they descend on Washington DC for an epic crime spree. <br><br>The CRIMENET network offers a huge range of dynamic contracts, and players are free to choose anything from small-time convenience store hits or kidnappings, to big league cyber-crime or emptying out major bank vaults for that epic PAYDAY. While in DC, why not participate in the local community, and run a few political errands?<br><br>Up to four friends co-operate on the hits, and as the crew progresses the jobs become bigger, better and more rewarding. Along with earning more money and becoming a legendary criminal comes a character customization and crafting system that lets crews build and customize their own guns and gear.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Rob Banks, Get Paid – Players must choose their crew carefully, because when the job goes down they will need the right mix of skills on their side.<br></li><li>CRIMENET – The dynamic contract database lets gamers pick and choose from available jobs by connecting with local contacts such as Vlad the Ukrainian, shady politician &quot;The Elephant&quot;, and South American drug trafficker Hector, all with their own agenda and best interests in mind.<br></li><li>PAYDAY Gunplay and Mechanics on a New Level – Firing weapons and zip tying civilians never felt so good.<br></li><li>Dynamic Scenarios – No heist ever plays out the same way twice. Every single scenario has random geometry or even rare events.<br></li><li>Choose Your Skills – As players progress they can invest in any of five special Skill Trees: Mastermind, Enforcer, Ghost, Technician and Fugitive.

One, it focuses on a single weapon, the Colt 1911 A1, and takes it very seriously, using &quot;high detail gun mechanics&quot;, which means you can &quot;manipulate each part of the gun independently&quot; (the beginning of the video shows this in action). The second is that it's a randomly-generated shooter that features permanent death. Taking place inside a single building, every time you die, you have to start at the very beginning again, but the entire game world is re-rolled. It's available now for $5, which given the ideas on show, is totally worth it just to check it out.&quot;<br>– <a href=\"http://kotaku.com/5919788/the-shooter-that-changes-every-time-you-die\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Kotaku</a><br><br>&quot;Receiver didn’t cast me as some nigh-invincible mass of regenerating muscle.

Options let you choose your weapons when spawning, or have weapons as map pickups for classic arena shooter style gameplay.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Unique Infection mode</strong></h2>One player starts as a zombie with the goal of infecting the other players until they've all turned over to the zombie army. The humans can use the Minergun to build forts, while the zombies can dig through walls and use their tentacle grab to reach higher places or pull players toward them. Unique to our game is the ability to feast on player corpses to level up your zombie. You can play this mode with up to 30 players. We'll usually have a full 30 player lobby in our weekly JForce play date. Come join us! It's a very intense experience when you're the last man standing and you have a whole swarm of player-controlled zombies coming after you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Online co-op map making + completely destructible maps</h2>The Minergun makes map-creation easy and fun.

For each objective captured, they gain more reinforcement and time to attack the next. Defenders have a finite amount of reinforcements and must use each wisely. Once the third objective is captured by the attackers, a fourth cache objective must be destroyed, while the defenders have only one life to make a last stand.<br><br><i>Firefight</i> --- Three territorial objectives, one for each team, plus one neutral. Each team only respawns when they secure an objective. Secure all objectives or eliminate all enemy to win. Every life counts, making this a very suspenseful experience dependent upon teamwork.<br><br><i>Skirmish</i> --- In addition to three territorial objectives, each team has a supply cache to protect. Teams gain extra reinforcement waves until their cache is destroyed. When both teams have lost their caches and all reinforcement waves, it becomes a Firefight match.<br><br><i>Occupy</i> --- There is one central territorial objective in the area. The team that controls it does not deplete reinforcement waves. This gameplay in this mode is reminiscent to King of the Hill or &quot;tug of war&quot;.<br><br><i>Ambush</i> --- A high value target (&quot;HVT&quot;) must be escorted to an extraction point. It's one team's goal to make this happen and it's the other team's goal to stop this from happening at all costs. The HVT is only armed with a silenced pistol, but can pick up a weapon from a fallen enemy or teammate.<br><br><i>Strike</i> --- Three weapon caches must be destroyed by the attacking team to achieve victory. Destroying a cache earns the attackers more reinforcements and time on the clock. The defenders must retain at least one cache from being destroyed and eliminate the enemy team once their reinforcements run dry.<br><br><i>Infiltrate</i> --- The standard Capture the Flag mode, but with a twist. Your team's goal is to take the enemy's intel and return it to your base. Your team will only gain reinforcements when someone takes the enemy's intel, or when an enemy stealing your team's intel is neutralized. This mode requires very strong team coordination and strategy.<br><br><i>Flashpoint</i> --- One neutral territorial objective and two caches on each side. The goal is to secure the entire area, controlling the middle and destroying the enemy's caches. Your team respawns when they secure the territorial objective or destroy a cache objective.<br><br><i>Elimination</i> --- In this single life mode, attackers must destroy one of two weapon caches, or eliminate the enemy team within the time limit. Defenders must kill all attackers.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Cooperative Game Modes</h2><br><i>Checkpoint</i> --- Complete mission-based objectives in sequence against AI enemy. Each successful objective will respawn anyone who was eliminated along the way.<br><br><i>Hunt</i> --- Insurgents are dispersed in the environment, and your squad must eliminate all targets while locating and destroying the weapons cache. High on tension, with only one-life.<br><br><i>Survival</i> --- Play as Insurgents and fight against endless waves of progressively difficult Security enemies on night themed maps. Reaching safehouse objectives with your team earns you supply to purchase better weapons and spawns any dead teammates.<br><br><i>Outpost</i> --- Defend your supply cache against endless waves of enemy trying to destroy it.

For each objective captured, they gain more reinforcement and time to attack the next. Defenders have a finite amount of reinforcements and must use each wisely. Once the third objective is captured by the attackers, a fourth cache objective must be destroyed, while the defenders have only one life to make a last stand.<br><br><i>Firefight</i> --- Three territorial objectives, one for each team, plus one neutral. Each team only respawns when they secure an objective. Secure all objectives or eliminate all enemy to win. Every life counts, making this a very suspenseful experience dependent upon teamwork.<br><br><i>Skirmish</i> --- In addition to three territorial objectives, each team has a supply cache to protect. Teams gain extra reinforcement waves until their cache is destroyed. When both teams have lost their caches and all reinforcement waves, it becomes a Firefight match.<br><br><i>Occupy</i> --- There is one central territorial objective in the area. The team that controls it does not deplete reinforcement waves. This gameplay in this mode is reminiscent to King of the Hill or &quot;tug of war&quot;.<br><br><i>Ambush</i> --- A high value target (&quot;HVT&quot;) must be escorted to an extraction point. It's one team's goal to make this happen and it's the other team's goal to stop this from happening at all costs. The HVT is only armed with a silenced pistol, but can pick up a weapon from a fallen enemy or teammate.<br><br><i>Strike</i> --- Three weapon caches must be destroyed by the attacking team to achieve victory. Destroying a cache earns the attackers more reinforcements and time on the clock. The defenders must retain at least one cache from being destroyed and eliminate the enemy team once their reinforcements run dry.<br><br><i>Infiltrate</i> --- The standard Capture the Flag mode, but with a twist. Your team's goal is to take the enemy's intel and return it to your base. Your team will only gain reinforcements when someone takes the enemy's intel, or when an enemy stealing your team's intel is neutralized. This mode requires very strong team coordination and strategy.<br><br><i>Flashpoint</i> --- One neutral territorial objective and two caches on each side. The goal is to secure the entire area, controlling the middle and destroying the enemy's caches. Your team respawns when they secure the territorial objective or destroy a cache objective.<br><br><i>Elimination</i> --- In this single life mode, attackers must destroy one of two weapon caches, or eliminate the enemy team within the time limit. Defenders must kill all attackers.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Cooperative Game Modes</h2><br><i>Checkpoint</i> --- Complete mission-based objectives in sequence against AI enemy. Each successful objective will respawn anyone who was eliminated along the way.<br><br><i>Hunt</i> --- Insurgents are dispersed in the environment, and your squad must eliminate all targets while locating and destroying the weapons cache. High on tension, with only one-life.<br><br><i>Survival</i> --- Play as Insurgents and fight against endless waves of progressively difficult Security enemies on night themed maps. Reaching safehouse objectives with your team earns you supply to purchase better weapons and spawns any dead teammates.<br><br><i>Outpost</i> --- Defend your supply cache against endless waves of enemy trying to destroy it. Each successfully defended wave will bring in reinforcements of your teammates.<br><br><i>Conquer</i> --- Capture the objectives in the area and defend them from enemy trying to retake them. Destroy enemy weapon caches to thin out their numbers.","short_description":"Take to the streets for intense close quarters combat, where a team's survival depends upon securing crucial strongholds and destroying enemy supply in this multiplayer and cooperative Source Engine based experience.","supported_languages":"English<strong>*</strong>, French, German, Dutch, Polish, Portuguese - Brazil, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Italian, Spanish - Spain, Ukrainian<br><strong>*</strong>languages with full audio support","reviews":"“This game has me hooked and I see it as a proudly raised middle finger in the face of large developers who seem to completely ignore fairness and player equality in favour of potential income.”<br>9.0 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.hookedgamers.com/pc/insurgency/review/article-1188.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Hooked Gamers</a><br><br>“Insurgency is going to win fans for its gameplay.
